          I've been interested in creative writing since I was in high school. While my current studies and career pursuits
          give me very little free time, I still manage to fit in a few 10-minute writing drills here and there. Anyways,
          thought spills below. Hope you like it! :)

          <b>On <i>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</i> by D.H.Lawrence</b>

        <div class="content-format">
          <p style="font-size: 8pt; padding-top: 0.5%">* The below mini-essay was written on the Notes App over 30 minutes during my flight back to Vancouver on Oct. 15, 2016. So do take it with a grain of salt, please.</p>
          <p>Recently, I have found bits and pieces of free time to read again, but not enough time to fully commit myself to a new book. So I turned to DHL’s work, Lady Chatterley’s Lover, my all-time favourite.</p>
          <p>Or so I thought.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="para1" class="content-format" style="display:none; padding-bottom: 5%">
          My personal affair with this book goes far back to grade school. I started reading at an early age, and my mother bought me mostly child-friendly versions of science fiction and Greek mythology short story collections. As I grew older, she’d buy me abridged versions of world classics, which is how I got my first tastes of Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and the Bronte sisters. However, I never went through a classic work in its entirely until that Fall when I was twelve years old, sitting in the scorching mid-afternoon heat and bored out of my mind at my middle school’s sports event, and picked up Lady Chatterley’s Lover. They were giving out books from a large cardboard box as raffle prizes, and I remember that it was another girl who actually got the book. She didn’t even bother to open it upon seeing the word “lover” in the title and immediately turned around to ask if anyone wanted it. “I think I’ll pass on the book”, said the girl. Being a social outcast and a bibliophile, I jumped at the offer. As the event went on, I sat in the middle of a cheering crowd and flipped page after page, impossible to stop, devouring up beautiful landscape and the rich emotions and the tumultuous inner struggles that DHL brought to life with his words. And then I got to the part where Connie had her first affair with Mick.<br>
          And then I paused. Looked up and around. Felt my heart racing and my face burning up. Read those passages again. And again. And again. And my very first thought was: “How many copies of this book WERE THERE in that box?”<br>
          I had just started puberty around that time, and like most Chinese schools, we were not given proper sex education. My mother had taught me quite a bit about the biology of it all, but not much about what womanhood would be like. The version that I was reading was a Chinese translation which, for someone with a solid background in Chinese, made the descriptions of sexual activities seem all the more graphic.<br>
          So there I was, a twelve-year-old who knew less than Jon Snow, had my first womanhood experience in the dreary rooms of Wragby. As I followed Connie through her life events, or lack thereof with Clifford, I felt as if I’d found an older sister, speaking to me with infinite tenderness and great passion in her soft, womanly voice. I was too young to fully comprehend all of her thoughts, but the mere intimacy and confidence between me and the fictional character was enough to keep my mind glued to the book for the next couple of weeks and the years to come.<br>
          And then the years did come. And within those years I read classic after classic in full volumes, the original English version of LCL, and essays analyzing the book. Every time when I go through LCL, there’s something new for me to discover.<br>
          And this time I discovered that I do not like the book quite as much as I used to.<br>
          In all fairness, DHL’s mastery of words has been and will always be one of the most unparalleled in Modernist Literature. But times have changed and society has moved forward, which brings me to the flaws that I’ve found in the book - racism and homophobia. The two themes weren’t exactly the focus of the book but were injected in a seemingly casual way, which makes it even more horrifying to a modern reader. Excerpts below. Read at your own discretion:<br></br>
          <div class="content-format" style="padding-left: 2%; padding-right: 2%">
            ...Then there's the sort that puts you out before you really "come", and go on writhing their loins till they bring themselves off against your thighs. But they're mostly the Lesbian sort. It's astonishing how Lesbian women are, consciously or unconsciously. Seems to me they're nearly all Lesbian.'<br>
            'And do you mind?' asked Connie.<br>
            'I could kill them. When I'm with a woman who's really Lesbian, I fairly howl in my soul, wanting to kill her.'<br>
            'And what do you do?'<br>
            'Just go away as fast as I can.'<br>
            'But do you think Lesbian women any worse than homosexual men?'<br>
            ' I do! Because I've suffered more from them. In the abstract, I've no idea. When I get with a Lesbian woman, whether she knows she's one or not, I see red. No, no! But I wanted to have nothing to do with any woman any more. I wanted to keep to myself: keep my privacy and my decency.'<br>
            He looked pale, and his brows were sombre.<br>
            'And were you sorry when I came along?' she asked.<br>
            'I was sorry and I was glad.'<br>
            'And what are you now?'<br>
            'I'm sorry, from the outside: all the complications and the ugliness and recrimination that's bound to come, sooner or later. That's when my blood sinks, and I'm low. But when my blood comes up, I'm glad. I'm even triumphant. I was really getting bitter. I thought there was no real sex left: never a woman who'd really "come" naturally with a man: except black women, and somehow, well, we're white men: and they're a bit like mud.'<br>
            (Chapter 14)<br></br>
          </div>
          Okay, my reaction: WHAT. THE. FUCK?!!! HOW THE FUCK DID I MISS THAT PART WHEN I WAS READING THE BOOK BEFORE? Oh I might have skipped that chapter...and maybe half of the chapter after it…<br>
          To a certain extent, Mellors’ opinions did reflect what the society was like back then. After all, the novel was set in post-WWI Britain, when the Empire still had its colonies and aristocracy still contributed to the majority of social disparity. As homosexuality was a serious crime in Britain, perhaps Lawrence himself did not have much respect for gay or colored people to begin with. (These are merely my speculations. I am not a scholar in modernist literature and by no way trying to claim my opinions as authoritative.) I used to think that the book was revolutionary, a hard punch against the cruel class division that plagued Britain. Those opinions still hold, but on the revolutionary note, an additional disclaimer: at the time when it was written.<br>
          Apart from the racism and homophobia that I completely disagree with, I’ve also been mildly annoyed by how often the two main protagonists obsessed over the role that good sex plays in a relationship. Again, this was set in a time when women were discouraged from working or receiving higher education. But from a modern woman’s perspective, I can say for sure that a good relationship is so much more than mutual physical pleasure. Sure, it matters a lot, but so does individuality and a woman’s own ambitions. I can Ctrl+V more quotations of how she marveled at the fact that she gave herself completely to him and he gave herself completely to her and all that blah, but by this point I’d recommend reading the book and um, let’s see what you think of it.<br>
          Taking a step back, my disliking is quite unwarranted because “time has changed, and society has evolved”, a reason that rightly justifies a lot of the now-archaic views in older literary works. To bring it all together, I dislike those archaic ideas for what they are, and hold nothing against the author himself. After all, it took a very, very long time and countless Lawrence’s, each one a little bit more visionary than the previous, for women and our society as a whole to get to where we are right now. If DHL were to write the book today, a lot of the class and sexual tensions would have long ceased to be issues and replaced with new ones instead: Clifford would be an injured veteran who can’t get adequate medical insurance plans, Connie and Mellors would be arguing about the fact that she gets paid 77c on his dollar, and she’d ask fewer questions about why men are selfish in bed and more about why, as 50% of the population, women only make up less than 5% of the Fortune 500 companies’ CEOs.<br>
          Maybe it’s really time to commit myself to a new book. How about Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg?<br>
