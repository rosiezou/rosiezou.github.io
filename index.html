            the past two years and will be switching into Statistics in the upcoming semester. My passion for
            Machine Learning has motivated a lot of my previous hackathon projects and future career pursuits.

          I've been interested in creative writing since I was in high school. While my current studies and career pursuits
          give me very little free time, I still manage to fit in a few 10-minute writing drills here and there. Anyways,
          thought spills below. Hope you like it! :)

          <b>On <i>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</i> by D.H.Lawrence</b>
        </div>
        <div class="content-format">
          <p style="font-size: 8pt; padding-top: 0.5%">* The below mini-essay was written on the Notes App over 30 minutes during my flight back to Vancouver on Oct. 15, 2016. So do take it with a grain of salt, please.</p>
          <p>Recently, I have found bits and pieces of free time to read again, but not enough time to fully commit myself to a new book. So I turned to DHL’s work, Lady Chatterley’s Lover, my all-time favourite.</p>
          <p>Or so I thought.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="para1" class="content-format" style="display:none;">
        My personal affair with this book goes far back to grade school. I started reading at an early age, and my mother bought me mostly child-friendly versions of science fiction and Greek mythology short story collections. As I grew older, she’d buy me abridged versions of world classics, which is how I got my first tastes of Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and the Bronte sisters. However, I never went through a classic work in its entirely until that Fall when I was twelve years old, sitting in the scorching mid-afternoon heat and bored out of my mind at my middle school’s sports event, and picked up Lady Chatterley’s Lover. They were giving out books from a large cardboard box as raffle prizes, and I remember that it was another girl who actually got the book. She didn’t even bother to open it upon seeing the word “lover” in the title and immediately turned around to ask if anyone wanted it. “I think I’ll pass on the book”, said the girl. Being a social outcast and a bibliophile, I jumped at the offer. As the event went on, I sat in the middle of a cheering crowd and flipped page after page, impossible to stop, devouring up beautiful landscape and the rich emotions and the tumultuous inner struggles that DHL brought to life with his words. And then I got to the part where Connie had her first affair with Mick.<br>
        And then I paused. Looked up and around. Felt my heart racing and my face burning up. Read those passages again. And again. And again. And my very first thought was: “How many copies of this book WERE THERE in that box?”<br>
        I had just started puberty around that time, and like most Chinese schools, we were not given proper sex education. My mother had taught me quite a bit about the biology of it all, but not much about what womanhood would be like. The version that I was reading was a Chinese translation which, for someone with a solid background in Chinese, made the descriptions of sexual activities seem all the more graphic.<br>
        So there I was, a twelve-year-old who knew less than Jon Snow, had my first womanhood experience in the dreary rooms of Wragby. As I followed Connie through her life events, or lack thereof with Clifford, I felt as if I’d found an older sister, speaking to me with infinite tenderness and great passion in her soft, womanly voice. I was too young to fully comprehend all of her thoughts, but the mere intimacy and confidence between me and the fictional character was enough to keep my mind glued to the book for the next couple of weeks and the years to come.<br>
