          <b><i><u>Undergraduate Research Assistant</u></i></b>, University of Waterloo, May 2017 - present<br><br>
            <ul>
              <li> May - Aug 2017 (full time) <br>
                During my research term, I created a <a href="https://www.stata.com" target="_blank">Stata</a> plugin
                for random forest classification and regression. The backend code is written in Java, which
                acted as a secondary interface for the Random Forest class methods from the
                <a href="http://weka.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">WEKA Project</a>, developed
                by the University of Waikato. This project was part of
                <a href="http://www.schonlau.net" target="_blank">Prof. Matthias Schonlau</a>'s 5-year NLP research project on
                semi-automatic analysis of open-ended survey questions.<br>
                The plugin is published on Prof. Schonlau's website at
                <a href="http://www.schonlau.net/stata/" target="_blank">www.schonlau.net/stata/</a>.
                To install the plugin, simply type "net search randomforest" in the Stata command line and follow the instructions.
                Source code for the plugin is available upon request at
                <a href="https://git.uwaterloo.ca/schonlau/randomforest" target="_blank">git.uwaterloo.ca/schonlau/randomforest</a>.
                The plugin has been popular in the social science research community and has a user base ranging from public education researchers to Health Services Research staff at U.S. News & World Report.

              <li> Sep 2017 - Present (part time)<br>
                Since the end of my full-time contract, I have been continuing my work with Prof. Schonlau on a part-time basis while
                I continued to pursue my studies. My responsibilities included software maintenance based on user requests, as well as a <a href="RFPaperDraft.html" target="_blank">paper</a> that highlights the applications of the Random Forests algorithm in social sciences, with examples illustrated using the plugin that I developed.<br>
                For the May - Aug 2018 school term, I am focusing on producing a final draft of the paper, implementing a new Stata plugin for Prof. Schonlau's former PhD student, and preparing for the upcoming <a href="https://www.stata.com/meeting/canada18/" target="_blank">Stata User Conference</a> in Vancouver where I will be presenting my research results.

        <b><i><u>CSEye</u></i></b>, March 2018 - Present<br>
        This project was completed by myself and three other teammates as a final project for UWaterloo's Winter 2018 <i>Statistical Learning - Classification</i> course. We designed and implemented a new CNN architecture that performs 1:N facial verification with high accuracy without compromising ease of implementation and speed of execution, using a modified VGG16-based architecture for transfer learning and pre-trained weights from ImageNet as a starting point. One of the many unique features that we introduced in our CNN architecture is target-specific parameter prediction, which allows the target image weights to have more interaction with the candidate weights as opposed to simple proximity scoring using absolute distance. The training and testing data used for this project are pulled from the <a href="http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/" target="_blank">Labeled Faces in the Wild Database</a>. Due to time and resource constraints, we were only able to achieve 97% accuracy on the training data and 80% accuracy on the testing data. We have since obtained access to a 4 GPU machine from the Math Department and are currently continuing with the project.<br><br>
        The <a href="441proj.html" target="_blank">current paper draft</a> provides a clear explanation of the model design and implementation. Our team's main focus of this term is to tune the network so that it consistently achieves >95% testing accuracy without increasing the code runtime, as well as produce a final draft to submit to NIPS or CVPR. The jupyter notebook we've been working on up until recently can be found <a href="https://github.com/rosiezou/cvproj/blob/master/441proj.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <b><i><u>Multiple Imputation for Latent Variables</u></i></b>, Apr 2018<br>
        As a part of the Winter 2018 <i>Computational Inference</i> course final project, my teammate and I designed, implemented, documented, and thoroughly tested an R package that performs multiple imputation as well as pooled result analyses on survey data with ordinal responses. We were inspired by a multicultural identity survey data set that consisted of ordinal response survey questions designed with the intention of gauging the survey takers' opinions on three particular aspects of multicultural identity. These survey design aspects are treated as latent variables that need to be imputed. Our R package performs quantile regression on the survey responses in order to perform discrete-to-continuous variable mapping, before using a probit model and factor analysis to sample more continuous values of mapped survey responses. The hypothesized latent variables are then imputed multiple times and fitted over a linear model before the parameters are pooled and estimated using Rubin's Rule. It was a project that opened our eyes to the world of survey data analysis and pushed us to be more creative with our problem solving. <br><br>

        I have re-organized the submitted final report into an easy-to-navigate web page that can be accessed <a href="440proj.html" target="_blank">here</a>. (Some mathematical symbols on the page may not be supported by older browsers.) Please note that the figures and tables in the report are not generated real-time using the code segments due to rendering time and runtime issues that are specified in the "Discussion" section of the report. This page is a replica of the <a href="https://github.com/rosiezou/440proj/blob/Rosie/summary.html" target="_blank">summary.html</a> page generated from the respective Rmarkdown file located in my personal branch of the project repository, which can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/rosiezou/440proj" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <b><i><u>Parametric and Non-Parametric Analyses on Financial Data</u></i></b>, Apr 2018<br>
        For my Winter 2018 <i>Statistical Learning - Function Estimation</i> course's final project, my teammates and I decided to survey a variety of parametric and non-parametric models in order to predict log-scaled retained earnings of publically listed U.S. Companies. The data set we used was obtained from <a href="https://www.quandl.com/databases/SF1" target="_blank">Quandl</a>. Working with this data set was a little tricky, as we found out that almost half of the companies have a large number of missing columns due to the fact that they had been delisted. Additionally the original retained earnings had a number of outliers that would significantly affect the model fit but would have made the model less generalized if removed. Hence a lot of work went into data cleaning, pre-processing, and re-scaling.<br><br>

        Prior to model tuning, we used smoothing splines to perform variable selection. The statistical analyses methods surveyed in this project were <b>thin-plate splines</b>, <b>random forest</b>, and <b>boosting</b>. 100 training and testing sets were re-sampled from the cleaned data using Bootstrap. These data sets were used in calculating the Average Predicted Squared Error (APSE) when tuning the models' hyper-parameters.<br><br>

        Like the previous Multiple Imputation project, this project's final report has also been re-compiled into an easy-to-navigate web page, accessible <a href="444proj.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The original Rmarkdown file (which also includes the R code used) and the data set can be found on the github repository <a href="https://github.com/rosiezou/444proj" target="_blank">here</a>.

          Waterloop is University of Waterloo's team for the Hyperloop Pod Competition held annually at SpaceX HQ in California.
          I worked with the team as a software systems developer between May and August 2017, with a focus on data analysis and telemetry. Some major tasks I've taken on include the design and implementation of a navigation system using IMUs and optical sensors, noise reduction of raw sensor data using support vector regression, and the re-design of the system state diagram. I've been blessed with the opportunity to work with amazingly talented developers and engineers from many different programs, and it has been a wonderful learning experience.
