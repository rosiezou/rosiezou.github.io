        Hi! My name is Rosie Zou. I am a senior Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.<br></br>
        Over the past few years, I have developed a focused interest in machine learning and artificial
        intelligence. I am currently working part-time as an undergraduate research assistant with Prof.
        Matthias Schonlau from the Statistics and Actuarial Science department at the University of Waterloo.<br></br>
        I've also worked on a variety of short-term and long-term team projects in mobile/web app development and transportation.
        My role on these team projects has mostly involved designing and implementing machine learning algorithms.
        Please scroll down for more details on my experiences and skills. <br></br>Thanks for stopping by. Cheers!

        <div class="bodyText">
          <b>Undergraduate Research Assistant</b>, University of Waterloo<br>
            May 2017 - present<br>
            During my research term, I created a <a href="https://www.stata.com" target="_blank">Stata</a> plugin
             for random forest classification and regression. The backend code is written in Java, which
            acted as a secondary interface for the Random Forest class methods from the
            <a href="http://weka.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">WEKA Project</a>, developed
            by the University of Waikato. This project was part of
            <a href="http://www.schonlau.net" target="_blank">Prof. Matthias Schonlau</a>'s 5-year NLP research project on
            semi-automatic analysis of open-ended survey questions.<br>
            The plugin is published on Prof. Schonlau's website at
            <a href="http://www.schonlau.net/stata/" target="_blank">www.schonlau.net/stata/</a>.
            To install the plugin, simply type "net search randomforest" in the Stata command line and follow the instructions.
            Source code for the plugin is available upon request at
            <a href="https://git.uwaterloo.ca/schonlau/randomforest" target="_blank">git.uwaterloo.ca/schonlau/randomforest</a>
            <br> Currently I am drafting a paper that highlights the applications of the Random Forests algorithm in social sciences, with examples
            illustrated using the plugin that I developed.

          <b>Equity Trading Intern</b>, TD Securities<br>
            Apr - Dec 2016<br>
            As a part of the algorithm trading team at TD Securities, I completed a variety of data analysis and visualization
            tasks during my internship, mainly using Python and VBScript. I had the opportunity to access
            high-volume historical trade data and analyze market segmentation, which helped our sales team create effective
            marketing campaigns that attracted more institutional clients.

            Sep - Dec 2015<br>
            While working with the Compliance team at Scotiabank, I assisted my PM with the financial reporting software
            migration project for Scotiabank Ireland in light of the introduction of Basel III regulations in Europe.

        <b>Waterloop</b><br>
          Waterloop is University of Waterloo's team for the Hyperloop Pod Competition held annually at SpaceX HQ in California.
          I worked with the team as a software systems developer between May and August 2017, with a focus on data analysis and telemetry. Some major tasks
          I've taken on include the design and implementation of a navigation system using IMUs and optical sensors, noise reduction of raw
          sensor data using support vector regression, and the re-design of the system state diagram. I've been blessed with the opportunity
          to work with amazingly talented developers and engineers from many different programs, and it has been a wonderful learning experience.

        <b>Hackathons</b><br>
          I have attended 8 hackathons since Sep 2015, where my role has mostly involved designing and
          implementing data analysis and machine learning algorithms for our teams' hacks.
          Here are some highlights.<br></br>
          <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left:-20px"><b>VisualTA</b>, DubHacks, Oct 2016<br>
              Our team developed a Hololens hack which performed real-time image analysis on faces, designed to
              be used as a visual aid for teachers with overcroweded classrooms to detect students who look confused.
              I designed and trained a decision tree algorithm from scratch over the weekend, which performed at
              an approximately 90% accuracy rate. Our hack won the prize for Best Use of Data Visualization at DubHacks.

            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left:-20px"><b>STEMLabs</b>, HackMIT, Sep 2016<br>
              Our team created a Hololens hack designed as a visual aid for students to visualize tough concepts in STEM.
              I worked on the animation scripts written in C#. We were one of the Top 10 teams during final presentation.

            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left:-20px"><b>Mortgage-Freeman</b>, MLH Prime, Aug 2016<br>
              Mortgage-Freeman is a web app that recommends mortgage plans based on the user's credit card history.
              I worked on designing and implementing the algorithms for calculating mortgage interest rates,
              monthly payments, and duration. I also optimized and reverse-engineered ordinary annuity formulas
              and performed regression analysis of U.S. 5/1 Adjustable mortgage rates using data from Quandl
              and python libraries like pandas and numpy. Our hack was runner-up for Best Use of Capital One's API
              and runner-up for Best Developer Tool, presented by GitHub. More details
